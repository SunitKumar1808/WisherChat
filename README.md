The Wishers Bot is a simple yet powerful tool designed to automate the sending of customized wishes to friends, family, colleagues, and clients. Whether it’s for birthdays, holidays, or special occasions, the Wishers Bot allows users to stay connected by sending personalized messages with minimal effort.

Key Features:
Secure Login System: Users start by entering their email ID and password to securely log in. This login system ensures that users can manage messages and maintain privacy over their email credentials.

Personalized Message Creation: Once logged in, users can enter the recipient's name and create a unique wish. This input feature allows users to quickly personalize messages based on the occasion or recipient, giving a personal touch to each communication.

Email Integration for Direct Sending: After the message is crafted, Wishers Bot connects to the user’s email account, enabling the message to be sent directly from their email, ensuring a seamless experience without needing to switch applications. It supports popular email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook, making it versatile for all users.

Automated Scheduling (optional): Users can also schedule wishes to be sent at specific times or dates. This feature is ideal for planning ahead for birthdays, anniversaries, and other recurring events.

Templates for Common Occasions (optional): The bot can offer pre-written templates for common occasions such as birthdays, New Year, and other celebrations. Users can select a template and modify it if needed, which makes sending quick and heartfelt wishes easier.

Technologies to Use for Creating the Wishers Bot:
To create this bot, here’s a suggested tech stack:

Frontend:

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the user interface, allowing users to enter their login credentials and the message details.
React or Angular (optional): For a more dynamic and responsive UI, especially if you want to include additional features like scheduling and templates.
Backend:

Node.js with Express: To manage the backend logic, handle user authentication, and provide API endpoints for message creation and email integration.
Python (alternative backend option): Using Flask or Django if you prefer Python for handling backend processes and integrating with email APIs.
Database:

MongoDB or Firebase (optional): To store user login credentials (securely hashed), recipient information, and message templates.
Email Integration:

Nodemailer (for Node.js): A reliable tool for sending emails directly from the backend, which can integrate well with Gmail and other providers using OAuth2 for secure email access.
SMTP Libraries: Libraries like smtplib for Python can also be used if implementing the backend in Python.
OAuth2 Authentication: To securely connect with users’ email providers without exposing passwords. OAuth can be used with providers like Gmail to maintain a secure connection for sending emails.
Security:

bcrypt or argon2: For hashing and securely storing user passwords.
OAuth2 Protocol: For secure email access, ensuring that sensitive login information remains private.
Optional Add-ons:

Scheduler (e.g., cron jobs): To enable the feature of sending messages at scheduled times.
Message Templates: A template library in the database or frontend, offering pre-written messages.
How It Works:
Login: The user enters their email and password, and the bot authenticates their details securely.
Create a Wish: Once logged in, the user enters the recipient’s name and writes a personal wish. They can also select a template or schedule the wish for a later date if those features are enabled.
Send: The bot connects to the user’s email provider using OAuth and sends the wish directly to the recipient, giving the message a personal and professional touch.
